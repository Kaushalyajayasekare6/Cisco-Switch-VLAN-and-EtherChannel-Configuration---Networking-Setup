# 🚀 **Cisco Switch VLAN & EtherChannel Configuration** ⚡

## 🌟 **Project Overview**
Welcome to the **VLAN & EtherChannel Configuration** magic, where we take Cisco switches to the next level! This project demonstrates a clean and efficient configuration for building scalable and high-performing networks using VLANs and EtherChannel. Ready to supercharge your networking skills?

## 🔧 **What You’ll Learn**
In this repository, you’ll dive into:
- **VLANs** for network segmentation, keeping your traffic organized and efficient.
- **EtherChannel** for boosting your bandwidth and ensuring network redundancy.
- **Trunking** for passing multiple VLANs between switches, making sure your network stays connected seamlessly.

## 🚨 **Key Features**
- **VLAN Creation**: Organize traffic with VLANs (AA and BB), making your network more secure and manageable.
- **Access Ports**: Assign ports to specific VLANs for clear, easy traffic flow.
- **Trunking & EtherChannel**: Enable link aggregation with **LACP**, ensuring fast, redundant, and reliable connections between switches.

## ⚡ **Quick Start Guide**
Getting this up and running is a breeze:
1. **Clone** this repository to your local machine.
2. Copy the configuration from the `config.txt` file.
3. **Paste** the configuration into your Cisco switch’s CLI.
4. Run `show etherchannel summary` to verify everything is running smoothly.


💡 Why This is Awesome
Scalable Networking: Whether you’re managing a small office or a large data center, VLANs ensure smooth traffic management.

Fault Tolerance: EtherChannel keeps your network resilient by bundling links for redundancy.

High Availability: With LACP, your connections stay active even if one link fails, keeping your network live and uninterrupted.
