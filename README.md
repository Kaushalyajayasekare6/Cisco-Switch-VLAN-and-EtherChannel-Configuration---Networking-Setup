# üöÄ **Cisco Switch VLAN & EtherChannel Configuration with LACP** ‚ö°

## üåü **Project Overview**
Welcome to the **VLAN & EtherChannel Configuration** project! This setup takes your Cisco switches to the next level by using **LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol)** to create high-speed, fault-tolerant links between switches. It‚Äôs time to **optimize your network** with reliable and scalable connections.

## üîß **What You‚Äôll Learn**
In this repository, you‚Äôll dive into:
- **VLANs** for network segmentation, allowing for more efficient traffic management and improved security.
- **EtherChannel** with **LACP** for **link aggregation**, boosting bandwidth and creating **redundancy** to prevent network downtime.
- **Trunking** for passing multiple VLANs between switches, ensuring smooth and uninterrupted communication.

## üö® **Key Features**
- **LACP-Powered EtherChannel**: Create dynamic link aggregation for high-speed, fault-tolerant connections.
- **VLAN Creation**: Efficiently organize network traffic by assigning specific VLANs for better control and security.
- **Access Ports**: Assign ports to specific VLANs for clear traffic flow.
- **Trunking**: Pass multiple VLANs between switches for seamless communication and network growth.

## ‚ö° **Quick Start Guide**
Getting this up and running is simple:
1. **Clone** this repository to your local machine.
2. Copy the configuration from the `config.txt` file.
3. **Paste** the configuration into your Cisco switch‚Äôs CLI.
4. Run `show etherchannel summary` to verify the success of your EtherChannel (with LACP) setup.

### Example Commands:
```bash
Switch# conf t
Switch(config)# hostname sw1
Switch(config)# vlan 10
Switch(config-vlan)# name AA
Switch(config-vlan)# exit
...
```

## üí° **Why This is Awesome**
- **Scalable Networking**: Perfect for small to large networks, VLANs allow for organized traffic flow.
- **Resilient & Fast**: EtherChannel with LACP ensures your connections are fast and fault-tolerant, reducing the risk of downtime.
- **High Availability**: With **LACP**, your network remains active even if one of the links fails, ensuring uninterrupted service.

## üåç **Perfect For:**
- **Networking Enthusiasts**: Ideal for anyone eager to learn about Cisco VLANs, EtherChannel, and LACP.
- **Students & Engineers**: A hands-on project to practice **LACP** and networking principles.
- **Cisco Admins**: A real-world configuration that can be adapted to various network environments.
